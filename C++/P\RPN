//all values in a recursive function are put in a stack and executed/popped in a LIFO manner.
the way to write arithmetic expression is knows as a notation
an arithmetic expresson can be written 
//three types f notations are there
1.infix notation: 
2.prefix/polish notation: operations are written before operands(+ab,-ab)
3.postfix/reversed polish notation: operator is postfixed to the operands(ab+,ab-)
eg: 
a(bc*(def^/)g*-)h*+
*-a/bc-*def
//evaluating postfix by stack(notebook)
